# JS Dom

## Tower of Babel
Use a loop to create three divs twoer on the page.

## Look At the Size of That Thing!
Place a div, blue background, 100px by 100px. Every time it is clicked, grow it by 10%.

## That's a Lot of Div
Put 100 divs on the page - each one 20px by 20px, with a random color. Set their float CSS attribute to left. Reminder: You may only use JavaScript, as demonstrated in the lecture, to complete your objective.

## Don't Stand in the Fire
A div on the page - 100px by 100px.  Make it yellow. Use "onmouseover" and "onmouseout" (as opposed to "onclick") to make it turn red when the mouse pointer is over it, and back to yellow when the mouse pointer leaves. Reminder: You may only use JavaScript, as demonstrated in the lecture, to complete your objective.
